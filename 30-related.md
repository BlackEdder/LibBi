OctBi is a package for [GNU Octave](http://www.octave.org) with functions for
plotting the outputs of LibBi. It is not a complete environment for calling
LibBi from within Octave, however.

It will not work with MATLAB out-of-the-box, as the NetCDF library for MATLAB
differs from that for Octave. Contributions that get this package working with
MATLAB are welcome.

RBi is a work in progress to create a package for
[R](http://www.r-project.org) with similar functionality to OctBi. It has
limited functionality at this stage.
