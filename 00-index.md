LibBi is used for state-space modelling and Bayesian inference on modern
computer hardware, including multi-core CPUs, many-core GPUs (graphics
processing units) and distributed-memory clusters.

The staple methods of LibBi are based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). This
includes particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) and SMC<sup>2</sup>
methods. Extra methods include the extended Kalman filter and some parameter
optimisation routines.

LibBi consists of a C++ template library, as well as a parser and compiler,
written in Perl, for its own modelling language.
