Getting started
===============

Download
--------

Use the button on the left to download the latest version. The download is the
same for all platforms.

Install
-------

LibBi runs on Linux, and on Mac OS X with dependencies installed from the
[MacPorts](http://www.macports.org) project. It has not been tried on Windows;
[Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com) would be a good bet, however, and if you do
get it running there the contribution of installation instructions would be
appreciated.

Installation instructions are in the `INSTALL.md` file of the distribution.

Run
---

The [introductory paper](/papers) is a good place to start, followed by the
[user manual](/documentation). The examples in the introductory paper are
available [here](/packages/Windkessel.html) and
[here](/packages/Lorenz96.html), along with [others](/examples.html), for you
to download and run.

Share
-----

LibBi provides a packaging system for bundling model specifications and input
files. If you have a package to share please contact <a
href="mailto:lawrence.murray@csiro.au">Lawrence Murray</a>. It can be readily
added to the <a href="/examples.html">Examples</a> page via GitHub.

Develop
-------

Contributions to LibBi can take many forms:

* Expanding language support, e.g. with new probability distributions.
* Adding new inference methods.
* Adding new hardware support.
* Better integrating LibBi with software such as R, MATLAB, GNU Octave and
  Julia.
* Supporting Windows.

If you are interested in getting involved in the development of LibBi, please
contact <a href="mailto:lawrence.murray@csiro.au">Lawrence Murray</a>. The
[user manual](/documentation) also contains a developer guide to help you get
started.
